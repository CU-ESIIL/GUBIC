# GUBIC: Global Urban Biological Invasions Consortium

Welcome to the **GUBIC** repository, an integral part of the Environmental Data Science Innovation and Inclusion Lab (ESIIL). This repository is the central hub for our working group, encompassing our project overview, proposals, team member information, codebase, and more.

## Our Project

Biological invasions are widespread in human-dominated landscapes, often resulting in ecological, social, economic, and human health impacts due to altered ecosystem services and control efforts of these non-native species. Until recently, the study of biological invasions has focused on developing concepts, frameworks, and paradigms mainly for (semi)natural ecosystems. However, urban ecosystems differ in their association with human-made infrastructures and complex cultural and socioeconomic factors that highly modify environmental conditions. These urban attributes can facilitate the introduction and establishment of non-native species. For example, the dispersal of non-native species is largely governed by trade and travel between cities. Regional species pools are filtered into local urban assemblages by human-constructed landscapes. Historical contingencies in community assembly in urban areas are influenced by city age and human colonization history. Further, differences in human culture, economic systems, and structure across cities likely drive variation in the establishment of non-native species. Therefore, integrating environmental and ecological data that are likely to influence non-native speciesâ€™ establishment (e.g., traits, climate, habitat) with interdisciplinary data on the cultural, socioeconomic, and historical attributes of cities is essential for understanding the diversity, impact, and management of non-native species in cities worldwide. In the proposed ESIIL working group, we will tackle this challenge by harmonizing heterogeneous data on non-native plant species and environmental, cultural, socioeconomic, and structural factors for >500 cities across the world. We will then use this dataset to test hypotheses about the causes and consequences of non-native plant species in urban environments.
